    	<DESC>Hi, My name is Kevin Gandhi.  I recently graduated from Drexel University which is located in Philadelphia PA, USA.  I earned a Bachelors of Science in Economics and a Bachelors of Science in Business.  My interests include writing, oil painting, and travelling.  I was born in the States and grew up there, but I have made a few trips to India in my youth.  I have found India to be more interesting every time I come back.  For me, the poverty issue in India and in many developing countries was not only their issue but something to be addressed by the whole world. I did not want to just give money and have faith that it would be used well, I wanted to be involved.  Furthermore, as someone who studied Economic Development I wanted to work in something that focused on long term self-sufficient stability and not a quick fix.  The vision of Digital Green seems to fit that frame work, but it also shows the ability to change and mend with the myriad of differences that such a complex problem involves. </DESC>
