		<DESC>While travelling around rural India two years back, I was repeatedly told by farmers that foremost on their list of concerns was limited access to water and information. This is why I joined Digital Green. I hope that by working here I will be able to bridge at least some of the gap that exists in bringing good quality information to farmers. For the last three years, I have worked in the development sector on issues such as education, health and livelihoods. After completing a MA Development Studies from the Institute of Development Studies (IDS), University of Sussex, I worked in the United Kingdom as a research consultant with IDS on participatory learning initiatives and as a volunteer with PLAN UK on its Because I am a Girl Project. I then decided to come back to India to be closer to the hot bed of path breaking and high impact development work. For a few months I worked as a communications consultant with BAIRD's CMC and as a researcher with PRADAN. I then joined a public policy think tank, Centre for Civil Society, as a research associate. Besides research, I was able to get diverse experience in fund-raising, organizational strategy planning, program management and advocacy. I now hope to use this knowledge and experience in contributing to achieving the Digital Green vision of sustainable rural development. In my spare time I like travelling, reading and painting. </DESC>
