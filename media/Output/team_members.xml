		<DESC>Shabnam's deep rooted passion is in bringing quality education to those who do not have access today, and until now, she has primarily focussed on children. After earning an Engineering degree from Carnegie Mellon University, Shabnam worked as an investment banker, a rural BPO manager, an educator to sex trafficked victims, a co-founder of MILLEE educating children using mobile phone games, an independent researcher of education products in India, a pre-primary school teacher, and lastly the founder of an SMS feedback mechanism for students to have a voice in their classrooms and education, called 'HobNob' while simultaneously starting a global conference focussed on failure, called 'Hindsight'. Her long term vision for Digital Green is to take the model far beyond the farmers one day. Having spent so much time trying to educate children better, she realized that the key lies not in the tool but in the hands of the people, in this instance, the teachers. Imagine the possibilities of taking Digital Green to teachers worldwide and giving them the resources to be better teachers to the children!! In the shorter term, she hopes to scale Digital Green to various other countries by truly understanding what farmers needs are and how we can pivot the model to reach millions and empower from within.</DESC>

		<DESC>While travelling around rural India two years back, I was repeatedly told by farmers that foremost on their list of concerns was limited access to water and information. This is why I joined Digital Green. I hope that by working here I will be able to bridge at least some of the gap that exists in bringing good quality information to farmers. For the last three years, I have worked in the development sector on issues such as education, health and livelihoods. After completing a MA Development Studies from the Institute of Development Studies (IDS), University of Sussex, I worked in the United Kingdom as a research consultant with IDS on participatory learning initiatives and as a volunteer with PLAN UK on its Because I am a Girl Project. I then decided to come back to India to be closer to the hot bed of path breaking and high impact development work. For a few months I worked as a communications consultant with BAIRD's CMC and as a researcher with PRADAN. I then joined a public policy think tank, Centre for Civil Society, as a research associate. Besides research, I was able to get diverse experience in fund-raising, organizational strategy planning, program management and advocacy. I now hope to use this knowledge and experience in contributing to achieving the Digital Green vision of sustainable rural development. In my spare time I like travelling, reading and painting. </DESC>
