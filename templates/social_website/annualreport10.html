                            <p class="copy copy-margin">Digital Green is evolving: It started as an idea that became a research project that was evaluated and then extended and now is scaling up. In some ways, we have crossed from one stepping-stone to the next in sequence. In other ways, the journey has been more iterative and cyclical. 
                            </p>
                            
                            <p class="copy copy-margin">
                            	I recently visited Mahabubnagar, Andhra Pradesh to meet a group of eleven women from the nearby area who were getting introduced to filmmaking for the very first time.  They had never held a camera nor been on camera before and, though I couldn't understand a word of the Telugu that they spoke, they were clearly engrossed in learning how to do so. In less than two and a half days, these women were developing storyboards, shooting videos in the field, editing them on a computer, and sharing tips with one another on how they could make them better. Check out a 3-minute highlight reel of the women in action <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk9VRn6bT6U' target='_blank'>here</a>
                            </p>
                            
                            <p class="copy copy-margin">
                            	Of course, this was just a beginning for the women - and for us.  That training program marked the beginning of our partnership with the Government of India's National Rural Livelihoods Mission, <a href='http://go.worldbank.org/BSS10ZFQG0'>one of the world's largest poverty reduction initiatives</a>, in which we will be looking to connect with over 1 million farmers across 10,000 villages over the next three years.  It' an exciting opportunity for scale and sustainability, but the magnitude of such numbers is difficult to fathom.  Just as we <a href='/update' target='_blank'>started</a> in 2006 and the <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HTsrigrUQY' target='_blank'> boot camp</a> that launched the Digital Green team in 2009, it's a process that involves one farmer, one village at a time. 
    						</p>
    						
    						<p class="copy copy-margin">
    							Together with our <a href='/partnerexecutive' target='_blank'>partners</a>, we're working to help build and support the aspirations that individuals seek to achieve.  Our network of <a href='/teammember' target='_blank'>team members</a> and <a href='/partnerexecutive' target='_blank'>partners</a> has <a href='/projectprogress10' target='_blank'>developed our capabilities considerably</a> over the last five years. Seven NGO partners now work with us in over 900 villages across 6 states in India and have produced over 1,800 videos that have been screened more than 45,000 times to over 60,000 farmers. In a rough assessment in Orissa, we found that the cost-effectiveness of two of our partners' existing interventions increased by a factor of 4-5x and had resulted in gains of around US$ 242 per farmer in the first year of our work together.

                            	We're humbled to see that sort of impact and plan to work with <a href='http://www.poverty-action.org' target='_blank'>Innovations for Poverty Action</a> for a more rigorous assessment.  We also continue to capture, analyze, and share data on the progress we're making in near real-time on our <a href='http://analytics.digitalgreen.org' target='_blank'>analytics dashboards</a>. I'd also encourage you (and your friends!) to play our Facebook game, <a href='http://apps.facebook.com/wondervillage' target='_blank'>Wonder Village</a>, developed in-house by our technology team, and join the over 17,000 people who are building their own villages and connecting with real ones.

                            	We have much farther to go and we've been reflecting on <a href='/challenge10' target='_blank'>how we can do things better</a>.  Most especially, nurturing our partnerships with organizations and communities: listening to what's going well, what's not, and how we can improve our work together.   We're iterating our <a href='/sop' target='_blank'>standard operating procedures</a> based on the learnings and challenges that we're encountering in the field and have drafted a broader <a href='/qualityassurance' target='_blank'>framework for ensuring quality</a> as we go to scale.  We're increasing our focus not just on the efficiency gains of combining technology with social organizations, but also the ultimate impact that it makes in the lives of individuals.

                            	Though our work has focused on agricultural development, the videos feature a diverse range of issues: from accessing inputs to organizing self-help groups to facilitating microcredit and savings to improving production techniques to linking with markets and government programs. As we work with the Government of India's Ministry of Rural Development and others, we'll be leveraging the platform to integrate initiatives in public health and nutrition and primary school education.

                            	Digital Green has primarily scaled by building on its partnerships with seven non-governmental organizations- namely, <a href='http://www.pradan.net' target='_blank'>PRADAN</a>, <a href='http://www.baif.org.in/aspx_pages/index.asp' target='_blank'>BAIF</a>, <a href='http://www.samprag.org/' target='_blank'>Samaj Pragati Sahayog</a>, <a href='http://www.accessdev.org/' target='_blank'>ACCESS</a>, <a href='http://www.asaindia.org/' target='_blank'>Action for Social Advancement</a>, <a href='http://www.pragatikoraput.org' target='_blank'>PRAGATI</a>,  and <a href='http://www.ngogateway.org/user_homepage/index.php?id=239' target='_blank'>VARRAT</a> - 
    							and recently began a partnership with the Government of India's National Rural Livelihoods Mission.  
    							As described in our 2009-10 annual report, these partnerships were established after a competitive review and due diligence process that evaluated the domain expertise, 
    							operational strength, and community-level rapport of each organization.  Sub agreements then were finalized in which mechanisms for cost effectiveness, quality assurance, and sustainability were emphasized. 
    		
    		 
    							Digital Green's team bootstrapped the technology and social organizational elements of the model with each partner and progressively transitioned to regional offices in Bangalore, Bhopal, Bhubaneswar, and New Delhi to provide the necessary technology development 
    							and resource agency support to each partner.  The Digital Green system now involves 58,902 farmers across six states in India: Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Orissa.  Supporting these activities, the Digital Green team includes 
    							22 core team members, 102 partner staff, and 524 community intermediaries. On average, it took 1.3 days to operationalize each additional village in the first year and 0.6 days in the second year, a 2-fold gain in the efficiency of our own work. 
                        	</p>
                        	
                        	<p class="copy">
                            	As Digital Green system has scaled, we have focused on enhancing the system to support the scope and diversity of stakeholders at the institutional-level partners as well as grassrootslevel communities that we work with.  
    							An internal team has been established to refine our training programs to advance the capabilities of the community intermediaries involved in producing videos, mediating video screenings, and capturing farmerlevel feedback to 
					    		sustain participation and adoption levels over time. We also initiated an effort to improve upon our <a href='/qualityassurance' target='_blank'>quality assurance framework</a> by building on our primary objective of improving the efficiency of our partners' existing extension 
					    		operations using our technology and social organization based model to now evaluate the ultimate productivity and income improvement that the content and our approach provide to the farmers that we work with.  
					    		In a preliminary assessment with two partners, <a href='http://www.pradan.net' target='_blank'>PRADAN</a> and <a href='http://www.ngogateway.org/user_homepage/index.php?id=239' target='_blank'>VARRAT</a>, in Orissa, we found that the classical extension systems that these NGOs operated had a cost per adoption of US$ 10-18 whereas the 
					    		Digital Green model integrated with their existing extension operations had a cost per adoption US$ 3-4- an improvement of 45 times, per dollar spent.  Additionally, a very prelimianry, limited sample analysis found that in the 
					    		first 8 months in which the Digital Green system had been deployed resulted in an average cumulative increase in incomes of US$ 242 per farmer in one cluster of villages in Orissa.  We have planned a more rigorous evaluation of the 
					    		efficiency and efficacy of the Digital Green both internally as well as in collaboration with researchers from <a href='http://www.poverty-action.org' target='_blank'>Innovations for Poverty Action</a>, Yale University, and University of California, Berkeley using 
					    		multiintervention, randomized controlled trial methods for the next phase of our work.

The SOPs essentially frame the technology and social organizational 
						    	components of the Digital Green system - from topic identification to video production to dissemination to feedback analysis - which ensure coherence and consistency in the processes and outcomes of the model while allowing for locally appropriate adaptation.  
						    	We have also refined our backend technology stack to better capture and analyze progress data and farmer feedback from areas that have limited to no electricity and Internet connectivity through a combination of paper-, phone-, and web-based channels.  
						    	We have identified four areas in our work that require particular focus: partnership management, impact assessment, quality assurance, and sustainability.  Internal teams have been constituted to investigate each of these areas by surveying our existing work 
						    	across partners and geographies and capturing the challenges and learnings that we have had till date. A combination of small-scale pilots and reflection exercises are then used to develop our capabilities in each area.  We have also strengthened our organizational 
						    	capacity with an <a href='/teamboard' target='_blank'>expanded board of directors</a>, improved personnel policies and procedures, and a robust financial management policy.

    							We are working with a manufacturer in India to develop and employ a mobile device that combines the functionality of a cell phone, camera, and pico projector that is currently priced at US$ 135.  We envision that such a device could replace the standalone pico projectors that we currently use within the next 5 years and 
    							that the price point could reduce to a level that would be affordable to a larger fraction of rural consumers.

		                            	The Digital Green system has been used to disseminate information on a wide variety of agricultural technologies - new varieties and classes of crops, better methods of seed planting, irrigation, soil and pest management and composting. Some of these technologies are quick and easy to implement, while others require substantial effort and inputs over time. We thus expect to identify the efficacy of Digital Green for a range of technologies.  We are working with researchers from <a href='http://www.poverty-action.org' target='_blank'>Innovations for Poverty Action</a>, University of California, Berkeley, and Yale University to design and conduct a randomized controlled trial of the approach as a part of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation-supported <a href='http://atai-research.org/' target='_blank'>Agricultural Technology Adoption Initiative (ATAI)</a> at MIT's Abdul Latif Jameel- <a href='http://www.povertyactionlab.org/' target='_blank'>Poverty Action Lab</a>.

		                            	An evaluation of Digital Green would make four primary contributions to broader policy and academic debates. The first contribution would be clean and well-identified estimates of the impacts of agricultural extension on farmer outcomes. The second main contribution of an evaluation of Digital Green would be an improved understanding of the informational constraints to technology adoption.  Third, a careful evaluation of the Digital Green approach could shed critical light on cost effective ways to provide extension services. Fourth, while the initial Digital Green evaluation will necessarily take place in India, lessons from Digital Green would have clear implications for agricultural extension elsewhere in the developing world, notably Africa.

		                            	The goal of our research program is to rigorously evaluate the performance of the Digital Green approach to extension services, relative to both the classical training and visit (T&amp;V) based approach and a no-extension control group. We will further seek to determine the exact mechanisms through which Digital Green operates, in order to identify the relevant barriers to adoption that are overcome. The research design will thus nest various levels of randomization. The design and consent protocols of these research studies will be approved, monitored, and reviewed by the institutional review boards of our partner institutions, including University of California, Berkeley.

		                            	As the Digital Green system scales, we are proactively committed to maintaining quality both in terms of (1) the efficiency of the extension system, which includes the production and dissemination of locally relevant content, as well as (2) its impact, which includes the increased take up of modern sustainable agricultural practices and the ultimate sustainable improvement in the socioeconomic status and self-efficacy of the communities that we work with.

									<p class="copy copy-margin">
										We employ a rigorous process in selecting partners supported by three core pillars: (1) locally relevant domain expertise, (2) established operational scale, and (3) community-level trust.  By closely collaborating with organizations that are focused on improving the well being of grassroots-level communities, our interventions are directed toward building the capacities of our partners to integrate and institutionalize our model of technology and social organization to improve the efficiency of their work and to broaden the participation of the community. 
									</p>
					
									<p class="copy copy-margin">
										Though there is some overlap, we have segmented our quality assurance strategies in two parts: (1) process quality and (2) content quality.  Process quality ensures that the aspects of the Digital Green system are institutionalized with the partners and communities that we work with in a consistent and coherent manner to improve the efficiency of existing extension systems whereas content quality ensures that the information exchanged across Digital Green-support extension system provides sustained, positive value for the members of the communities that adopt improved practices and technologies for themselves.  Digital Green captures a variety of process, output, and outcome metrics that are both qualitative and quantitative in nature.  This data is captured, analyzed, and shared across our technology stack: our online/offline data management framework, analytics suite of dashboards, videos library, and public website.  To ensure the quality of this data, our technology stack provides automated consistency checking functionality and periodic audits are used for cross-validation in the field.  Technical and aesthetic dimensions of produced videos and mediated instruction of video disseminations are assessed through checklists and surveys.

		            				<p class="copy copy-margin">
										To support these protocols, we will establish a directorate of quality assurance to anchor these processes and to coordinate exchanges and learnings across the organization.  The directorate will also work with Digital Green's partners and create supportive structures to manage the process quality and content quality assurance mechanisms.  For instance, a technical advisory panel of experts will be constituted to provide input into assessing and documenting the quality of content and assuring the ultimate impact that we seek to make in improving the livelihoods empowerment of the community.  Partnerships with the agricultural research community, such as the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), could allow for both the input of scientifically validated information into the content development process as well as potentially inform research agendas based on the practical data and feedback that smallholder farmers share through the Digital Green system.  Please view our <a class='quicklinks' href='/qualityassurance' target='_blank'>quality assurance framework</a> which incorporates existing and new elements.

									<p class="copy copy-margin">
										This quality assurance framework will be reviewed on a biannual basis to assess whether it is achieving the efficiency and impact gains that we seek to achieve.  Digital Green's board and senior management team along with representatives of relevant stakeholders will be requested to participate in these discussions and to determine if there might be opportunities for further refinement.

		                        	<h3 class="hdg-source-semibold hdg-c hdg-black layout-vr-sm">Sustainability</h3>
		                            <p class="copy copy-margin">
		                            	Extension services for smallholder farmers should primarily be considered a public good and we expect our collaboration with government extension systems to provide an opportunity for both scale and sustainability. Still, we believe it is important that the community take ownership of the system to drive its relevance and value. Concretely, our objective with sustainability is to have the recurring costs of the system supported by the community over time. We have experimented with a variety of modes for financial sustainability over the last two years. Initially, we used individual usage fees (e.g., US$ 0.04-0.08 per farmer per screening). We found that such ticket-based models led individuals to take unanticipated actions: maximizing the number of videos shown in a single screening, attending only those videos screenings that offered an immediate, tangible economic return, etc. To mitigate these effects, we explored usage fees that were designed as an annual or semi-annual subscription. At the same time, we found that some of our partners had introduced usage fees for their own interventions and that the community was double paying for equivalent or similar extension services. Consequently, we began packaging usage fees as a part of a basket of services that our partners or an affiliated community-based institution (e.g., producer company or SHG federation) might already be providing to its members.

		                            	To make further progress on sustainability, we will focus on two central aspects: (1) ensuring a positive value proposition for the community and (2) productizing our service. Our initiatives in quality assurance and impact assessment will directly determine the value that farmers realize primarily based on: (a) quality of videos, (b) quality of dissemination, and (c) the cost-benefit of the practices in the local context. We are also evaluating the possibility of flipping our model of having farmers subscribe or pay membership fees to cover the recurring costs of the system (mainly, the service provider's compensation) and instead have the community pay to purchase the access device (i.e., the pico projector) and have the community mediators services be provided for "free".

		                            	Digital Green as an organization is increasingly being commissioned by government agencies, like India's Ministry of Rural Development, and research organizations, like the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), to provide technology development and technical support services. Though still preliminary, our Facebook game, Wonder Village, has the potential to finance some of our initiatives going forward. In addition, we plan to pursue opportunities to build a base of core funding to better allow our organization to establish a lean, high-performance team and to develop our technology and training platform to support a greater variety and scale of collaborators that may pursue elements of the model by working together with or independently of Digital Green around the world.
